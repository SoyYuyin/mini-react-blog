We can install it by calling \n \n 'npx json-server --data/db.json --port 8000'\n \n In this command we tell the which file to watch as our database, in my case it's inside the data directory. Then specify which port to run on. We choose 8000 because usually the react dev server runs on port 3000. \n\nYou may be wondering why then it's taking an extra second to load info on the homepage.. well, that's just an aritifical timeout added to emulate how to handle the loading using conditional formatting.",
